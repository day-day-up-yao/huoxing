        <p>MITA token can be purchased as an In-App Purchase (IAP) using a debit or credit card from the Google Play Store or Apple Store. It can also be purchased from crypto exchanges and decentralized peer-to-peer platforms like Cryptolocally.com.</p>
        <p>The base price to purchase MITA tokens in the game will be $0.07 USD(subjected to change). If the average price per token on third-party exchanges increases above $0.07 (subjected to change) for an extended period of time, the price per MITA in the game will also increase to the new average price.</p>
        <p>In the event that a user decides to buy MITA via an IAP, they will be buying from our IAP reserve. Every 3 months, Gem Studios will buy MITA from the open market and keep this in the IAP pool, which will be sold to players buying MITA from the app stores.</p>
        <p>MITA tokens sold in the game will be 10%-15% premium than what it is on the open market or 3rd party exchanges to help cover the cost, fees, taxes on the various app stores.</p> */}
